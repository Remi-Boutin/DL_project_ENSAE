# DL_project_ENSAE
Code of the GANs and Cycle-GAN for [Marco Cuturi's DL course](https://marcocuturi.net/dl.html). The aim of this course is to use the [DC-GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) and the [Wassertein-Gan paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf)
to implement [Cycle-GANs](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/) with a convolutional generator and discriminator. 

We will try to follow and adapt the [detailed walk-through](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment4.pdf) to build our model step by step.
